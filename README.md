# YAUS: Yet Another URL Shortener

A dead simple URL shorter written in Ruby using Sinatra & SQLite3. No tracking, no metrics, no metadata. Just URL shortening.

*Why did I make a URL shortener?* I don't know, I was bored.

*Why Ruby & Sinatra?* Because I've never built anything in Ruby without Rails before.

*Will you add feature X?* Maybe.
